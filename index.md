## 1. Enterprise Authoring and Presentation Tools
*Reflecting on the effective use of Microsoft Office in academic and professional contexts.*

### Reflection on Tools & Usage
Throughout this module, I have moved beyond basic usage of office tools to applying professional standards:

* **Microsoft Excel & Data Management:**
    Based on the "Data Management" session (Week 5), I learned the importance of **Tidy Data Principles**. I now understand that data must be structured with variables in columns and observations in rows to be machine-readable. I have applied the **FAIR principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) to ensure my data is robust. Previously, I often mixed formatting with data, which makes analysis difficult; I now separate these concerns.

* **Science Communication (PowerPoint):**
    Drawing from the "Science Communication" session (Week 4), I learned that effective presentation depends entirely on the audience (e.g., General Public vs. Peers). I have improved my slide design by prioritizing visuals over heavy text and ensuring accessibility (e.g., using OCR-friendly fonts).

* **Microsoft Word:**
    I have transitioned to using automated features such as Styles, Tables of Contents, and the Navigation Pane to structure long reports. This ensures consistency and accessibility, which are key professional standards.

### AI Integration in Authoring
AI integration (such as Microsoft Copilot) has transformed data entry. In Excel, AI can now automate the extraction of patterns from unstructured text (Flash Fill) and generate formulas. However, as noted in our "Responsible Use of AI" sessions, one must remain wary of errors. While AI accelerates the setup of spreadsheets, human oversight is required to verify that the "Tidy Data" structure is maintained.

### Self-Assessment & Future Plan
* **Current Mastery:** Competent. I can structure data and reports professionally but sometimes struggle with advanced Excel macros.
* **Plan:** To achieve full professional mastery, I will complete the LinkedIn Learning certification on "Advanced Excel Data Analysis" by the end of Semester 2.

## 2. Information Literacy
*Reflecting on the ability to locate, evaluate, and use information effectively.*

### Search Strategies
Effective research requires more than simple keyword searches. I have learned to utilize library catalogues and databases (such as Scopus and Web of Science) using Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to refine results. A critical step I now take is evaluating sources not just for relevance, but for credibility—checking peer-review status and citation metrics.

### Critique of the PICO Model
To guide literature reviews, we explored the **PICO** model (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome).
* **Strengths:** PICO is excellent for quantitative and clinical research questions because it forces specificity. It stops the search from becoming too broad.
* **Weaknesses:** It can be too rigid for qualitative or exploratory research where an "Intervention" or "Comparison" may not exist. In those cases, models like SPIDER (Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, Research type) might be more appropriate.

### Self-Assessment & Future Plan
* **Current Mastery:** Proficient. I can formulate strong search strings.
* **Plan:** I plan to improve my use of reference management software (like EndNote or Zotero) to streamline the citation process during my dissertation.

## 3. Coding and Collaboration Platforms
*Reflecting on the transition from GUI to CLI and using Version Control.*

### Collaboration & Version Control
Learning Git and GitHub has shifted my workflow from saving multiple file versions (e.g., `final_v2.docx`) to true version control. These platforms enable public presentation of work via **GitHub Pages** (Deployment) and allow teams to collaborate without overwriting each other's work through branching and merging.

### Technical Description of Git
Based on our Command Line Interface (CLI) sessions (Week 7), I understand that Git is more than just a backup tool; it is a distributed database.
* **Data Structures:** Git stores data as **Blobs** (file contents), **Trees** (directory structures), and **Commits** (snapshots linking to trees and parent commits).
* **References:** Labels like `HEAD` or `main` simply point to specific commit hashes, allowing us to navigate history.
* **Commands:** I have mastered the basic workflow:
    * `git add`: Stages files (preparing the snapshot).
    * `git commit`: Saves the snapshot to the local history.
    * `git push`: Syncs the local history to the remote repository (GitHub).

### Strengths & Challenges
The main challenge was moving from a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to the Command Line (CLI). As noted in the "CLI Foundations" notes, understanding paths (Absolute vs. Relative) was initially confusing. However, the strength of the CLI is its speed and reproducibility—scripts allow me to repeat complex tasks exactly, which is impossible with mouse clicks.

### Self-Assessment & Future Plan
* **Current Mastery:** Novice/Competent. I am comfortable with basic pushing and pulling.
* **Plan:** I intend to learn how to handle "Merge Conflicts" and use "GitHub Actions" for automated testing by the next academic year.

## 4. Continuous Professional Development (CPD)
*Reflecting on professional identity and career readiness.*

### Personal Analysis & Graduate Attributes
To understand my position as a future professional, I undertook several diagnostic assessments in Week 10:

* **Belbin Group Roles:** The assessment identified my strengths as a **[INSERT YOUR ROLE, e.g., Shaper/Implementer]**. This awareness allows me to contribute more effectively to teams by focusing on [INSERT STRENGTH, e.g., driving tasks forward] while being mindful of my potential weakness in [INSERT WEAKNESS].
* **Big Five Personality Test:** My results highlighted [INSERT TRAIT, e.g., High Conscientiousness], which aligns with the graduate attribute of **Self-Management**. Understanding this helps me demonstrate reliability to future employers.
* **SRE (Skills, Relationships, Experience):** Using the SRE model, I mapped my current skills against career requirements. This highlighted a need to build more evidence in data visualization to meet the programme's specifications.

### Professional Networks
I am actively developing my professional presence by engaging with networks such as LinkedIn. By connecting with industry peers and following relevant societies, I ensure that my development remains aligned with current industry standards and the "marketable graduate attributes" defined in my degree programme.

### Self-Assessment & Future Plan
* **Current Mastery:** Developing. I have a strong understanding of my personal attributes.
* **Plan:** I will update my CV and LinkedIn profile with the specific skills identified in the SRE analysis by the end of this month.

## 5. Responsible Use of AI
*Reflecting on the ethics and mechanics of Coding Assistants.*

### Understanding AI Tools
As covered in Week 12 ("Effective Use of Coding Assistants"), AI tools fall into two categories: **Chat-based** (ChatGPT, Claude) and **IDE-integrated** (GitHub Copilot). These tools offer immense productivity benefits, such as generating boilerplate code and explaining complex syntax.

### Ethics, Hallucinations, and "Fake Literature"
However, relying on them carries risks. A major issue discussed was **"Hallucinations"**, specifically the **"Fake Literature" problem**, where AI fabricates citations and DOIs that look real but do not exist. This reinforces the need for a **"Trust but Verify"** workflow.
Furthermore, I am aware of the ethical implications regarding **"Deskilling"**—where over-reliance on AI prevents deep learning—and the **Carbon Cost** associated with training large models.

### Academic Integrity
I understand that submitting AI-generated work without acknowledgement is a breach of academic integrity. I am committed to using AI as a "scaffolding" tool—to help structure ideas or debug code—rather than a replacement for my own critical thinking.

### Self-Assessment & Future Plan
* **Current Mastery:** Competent. I use AI to explain code but always verify the output.
* **Plan:** I will keep up to date with the University’s evolving AI policy to ensure I remain compliant as technologies change.
